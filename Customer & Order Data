#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)

WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'
AND Product = "iPhone"

#Question 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales February

WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'

#Question 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1

#Question 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Product

#Question 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
Product,
SUM(Quantity),
ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price) as revenue

#Question 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)

#Question 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)

Group BY Product

#Question 9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

#Question 11.What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)

#Question 12.What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
